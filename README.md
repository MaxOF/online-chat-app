# Online chat with websockets

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). \
And Back-end was made with Express js and socket.io

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn server`

Runs server for app in order to make the room for chats.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


## How it works?

In order to make the general chat you should necessarily use common room. Enter to input your room and your \
friends enter to room which you choose. Then you can chat! It simple, isn`t it?
